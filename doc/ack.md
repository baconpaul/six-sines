# Acknowledgements

Lots of folks helped with and contributed to the
Six Sines sprint. Here's a few

## Beta Test Team

Members of the surge synth team joined in the beta
test period giving loads of constructive feedback.
Especially EvilDragon, Andreya/A.Liv, Jacky Ligon
and Kinsey Dulcet were massively helpful. Feedback
from Chris Johnson / Airwindows left the bad
resamplers intact for your listening pleasure. And 
many other folks tried and gave great feedback on
0.9... versions

## Factory Patches

The Factory Patch bank was a result of contributions
from early users who gave us large numbers of patches.

Kinsey and Jacky did all their patches 2 or 3 times as
the synth changed, and gave us huge swaths of the factory library.
The continual rework of their patches as the synth evolved
was a labor of love.

Once we stabilized also had substantial patch contributions from

- Metamyther
- Triniton
- dj.tuBIG/MaliceX

Thanks to everyone who contributed patches to highlight the synth!

## Open Source Libraries

Six Sines is a 'clap-first' synth, using the clap and clap wrapper
projects to project into various formats. Thanks to my collaborators
on the clap team - especially defiantnerd - for the work on making
this technology complete.

The Six Sines UI is based on the JUCE framework, a great bit of software. 
One of our resampling strategies is to use libsamplerate. We support
microtuning using MTS-ESP. The excellent simde (simd-everywhere)
library gives us portability to arm platforms. The implementation
fmt gives us string fomatting in C++17. And finally vast swaths
of six sines are actually the surge synth team open source libraries
configured in ways which pushed them around in new and exciting
ways.

But honestly, the project didn't exist to enlist testers.
