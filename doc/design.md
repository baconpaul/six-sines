TODO BEFORE 1JAN2025

MODULATION:
- Unison Sources

PATCH SELECTOR:
- Jog Buttons for next/prev

MAIN/PLAY MODE:
- Global Transpose

CLAP
- An output per OP wher each output is just the solo OP * Main ADSR (and zero if the OP is off)

GENERAL AND CLEANUPS
- Screen Reader Check
  - Toggles and Multiswitches dont have accesible set actions
  - Show menu doesnt work for set value
- Ctrl/Knob quantizes on ratio to PO2
- Write some semblance of a manual

THINGS I DIDNT GET TO FOR 1.0
- AM is somehow not quiet intuitive. Modulator signal to zero results in 'no output' but it sort of intuitively should me
  'no modulation'
- 90%-100% of internal nyquist mute fades (maybe ship without this tho)
- Main DAHDSR at DAHD=0 SR=1 means voice lifetime is longest active op mixer DAHDSR and main DAHDSR bypassed
- Note Expressions
- CLAP PolyMod
- Global tuning other than octave transpose
- A main LFO
