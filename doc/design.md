TODO BEFORE 1JAN2025

SOURCE:
- Keytrack on/off, and if off ratio -> offset from 440hz
- 90%-100% of internal nyquist mute fades (maybe ship without this tho)

MODULATION:
- Each item gets a modulation list from source set
- Monophonic Midi source
- Macro source
- Polyphonic Voice Source
- MPE source? (later)
- Note expressions? (later)

PATCH SELECTOR:
- Jog Buttons for next/prev

MAIN/PLAY MODE:
- Global Transpose and Global in-semitone-tuning with LFO routable to tuning
- Voice Unison
- It also occurs to me that the main AEG feels totally dumb in voice mode. default moves to gate

CLAP
- An output per OP wher each output is just the solo OP * Main ADSR (and zero if the OP is off)

GENERAL AND CLEANUPS
- Toggle button paint cleaner
- Ctrl/Knob quantizes on ratio to PO2
- We could have an envelope which trigers as !gated on release (and then ungates in mono-retrigger)
- AM is somehow not quiet right. Signal to zero seems 'no modulation' not 'no output'
- Don't send VU etc when editor not attached
- Main DAHDSR at DAHD=0 SR=1 means voice lifetime is longest active op mixer DAHDSR and main DAHDSR bypassed
