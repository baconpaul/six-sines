Six Sines is a fun little synth exploring the possibilities of audio rate modulation.  Some people
might call it an "FM" synth but its more PM and it also has AM. Surf the presets and twist the knobs
and you'll get the idea.

You've downloaded the zip file for either windows or linux (both have this same README) containing a clap,
a vst3, and a standalone executable.

To install the plugin you need to move the clap or vst3 to the appropriate place on your computer

On windows files, move them to `c:\program files\common files\clap` or `\vst3`
On linux, it is usually ~/.clap, ~/.vst or /usr/lib/clap and /usr/lib/vst3

To install just move the file into those locations using whatever mechanism you are happiest with
in your environment.

If you have feedback ideas etc open a github issue or drop into the #baconpaul-sidequests channel
of surge discord.

The six sines source code is released under the MIT license, but the final product contains GPL3 dependencies
so this release is released under the GNU General Public License, 3 or later. You can read that license in the
file License.txt included here.
