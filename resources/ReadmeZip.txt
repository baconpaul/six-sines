Six Sines - a small synth involving sine waves
https://github.com/baconpaul/six-sines

Hi!

Enjoy six sines. You downloaded a zip of the plugins containing an executable, a clap, a vst3, and perhaps
more.

To install the plugin you need to move the clap or vst3 to the appropriate place on your computer

On windows files, move them to `c:\program files\common files\clap` or `vst3`
On linx, it is usually ~/.clap, ~/.vst or /usr/lib/clap and /usr/lib/vst3

You can read the manual once you launch the synth by clicking the patch selector and opening the manual

The six sines source code is released under the MIT license, but the final prodct contains dependencies meaning
this release is released under the GNU General Public License, 3 or later

and have fun!
